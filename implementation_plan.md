# Phased Implementation Plan

This document outlines a clear, incremental roadmap for building, testing, and deploying our high‑edge trading engine. Each phase delivers a self‑contained slice of functionality that can be validated end‑to‑end before proceeding.

## Phase 1: Baseline Pipeline & Rule‑Based Backtesting
- Repository scaffolding: directory structure, dependency manager (poetry/pipenv), linting & formatting (Black, Flake8).
- Historical data ingestion: fetch 1‑second OHLCV bars via Alpaca REST for replay/backtests.
- Feature engineering module: implement EMAs, returns, VWAP z‑score, ATR, order‑flow imbalance, bid‑ask spread.
- Backtesting engine: integrate a tick‑level replay (Backtrader or custom) with realistic slippage & commission models.
- Rule‑based signals: code momentum & mean‑reversion strategies using threshold logic.
- Reporting & analytics: per‑trade PnL, drawdown, Sharpe, Sortino, and basic visualizations.

## Phase 2: Live Feed & Execution Framework
- Async architecture: bootstrap an `asyncio` event loop to consume Alpaca WebSocket streams for bars/trades/quotes.
- Live data processing: wire feature engine into real‑time ring buffers or memory caches.
- Order placement logic: implement limit orders (midprice ± buffer), marketable fallback, and OCO SL/TP pairs.
- Risk controls: enforce daily drawdown cap, max concurrent trades, time‑based kill on stale orders.
- Slippage & latency monitors: track real fills vs. theoretical, ping RTT and adapt buffers.
- Paper‑trade integration: route execution through Alpaca's paper environment and validate end‑to‑end.

## Phase 3: ML‑Driven Signals & Dynamic Sizing
- Training pipeline: build a daily retrain workflow for XGBoost (or light NN) with nested cross‑validation and purge & embargo.
- Feature store & live inference: expose model predict calls in the `on_new_tick` handler for real‑time alpha.
- Decision logic update: swap rule‑based thresholds for model probabilities (P_up, P_down) with trend filter.
- Fractional Kelly sizing: compute position size with 50% Kelly, cap at 1% equity, fallback to fixed fraction if stats insufficient.
- Model validation: maintain a rolling "cold start" holdout, track drift, and log confidence distributions.
- Live paper‑trade ML signals in parallel with baseline rules for performance comparison.

## Phase 4: Full Production & Continuous Learning
- Model governance: integrate MLflow (or DVC) for experiment tracking, model versioning, and reproducible runs.
- A/B testing: deploy new model versions in paper‑trade alongside live, compare performance before swap.
- Hyperparameter tuning: implement weekly Bayesian optimization of thresholds and model hyperparameters.
- Portfolio & capital allocation: add risk‑parity weights across multiple instruments and optional tail‑hedge overlay.
- Monitoring & alerting: build Grafana dashboards, Prometheus metrics, and Slack/email alerts for drift, drawdown, latencies.
- Infrastructure hardening: containerize services, configure Kubernetes/Docker‑Compose, establish CI/CD pipelines and secrets management.
- Operational playbooks: document on‑call procedures, failure modes, and recovery steps.
